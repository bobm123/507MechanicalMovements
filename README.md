# 507MechanicalMovements

An attempt to create example of each of the 507 Mechanical Movementes 
described in Henry T. Brown's 1868 book by that name. The idea is to 
create digital models of each suitable for fabrication with 3D printers
or laser cutters. By using open source tools it is hoped that these
example will prove useful for study and incorperation in new designs.
